# Media Ô∏è

Catalogue Your Favorite Artists and Their Work


## DEMO


## Description

Welcome to Media, a web app designed to create a catalogue of artists and their works, powered by an external API. 
Explore and manage a diverse collection of artists, albums, and other creative media.

## Tech Stack

Frontend: React
State Management: Redux
Data Format: JSON

## Features
Add New Artists: Easily expand the catalogue with new names.
Generate Album Lists: Automatically create lists of albums and other works for each artist.
Enhance with Visuals: Add pictures to bring artists and their work to life.

## Getting Started
Installation:

### Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Use Cases
Build a library of favorite artists and their works.
Organize and manage a collaborative collection within a team or community.
Provide opportunities to explore music, art, or other media.

## Motivation
In this project , I really wanted to : 

learn more about data fetching techniques within React and Redux.
Explore the challenges and possibilities of network requests and API integration.

## Challenges & Achievements
Managed to use lazy loading to optimize performance for users with limited bandwidth.

## Future Plans
Instead of using an external API for artist names and albums name, we will create forms for users to manually insert information of artists and work . 

This project was inspired by Stephen Grider (An amazing instructor from Udemy)
